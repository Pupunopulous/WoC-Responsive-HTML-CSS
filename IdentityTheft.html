Identity theft is a crime whereby criminals impersonate individuals, usually for financial&nbsp; gain. In today's society, you often need to reveal personal bits of information about&nbsp; yourself, such as your social security number,&nbsp; signature, name, address, phone number, cell number or even banking and credit card information. If a thief is able to access this&nbsp; personal information, he or she can use it to commit fraud in your name.<br><br>

Armed with your personal information, a malicious person could do any number of&nbsp; things, like apply for loans or new credit card accounts. It's possible they could request a&nbsp; billing address change and run up your existing credit card without your knowledge. A&nbsp; thief could use counterfeit checks and debit cards or authorize electronic transfers in your&nbsp; name and wipe out funds in a bank account.<br><br>

&nbsp;Identity theft can also go beyond a monetary impact. Thieves can use your information to &nbsp;obtain a driver's license or other documentation that would display their photo but your &nbsp;name and information. With these documents thieves could to obtain a job and file &nbsp;fraudulent income tax returns, apply for travel documents, file insurance claims, or even &nbsp;provide your name and mailing address to police and other authorities if involved in &nbsp;other criminal activities.

  The Federal Trade Commission is one of many organizations that provides valuable facts and information to consumers concerning identity theft, including preventative and resolutions to identity theft concerns. For consumers who believe they are a victim of identity theft, the FTC recommends you take immediate steps to protect yourself such as placing fraud alerts on your credit cards, filing police reports, and filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. It is also important to resolve specific fraudulent usage with organizations responsible for your bank accounts, credit cards, driver's license, investment funds, debt collectors and others.<br><br>

  To do this they urge consumers to protect their personal information. Start by asking&nbsp; companies how they use your information, and for online transaction, take a moment to&nbsp; review a website's privacy policy.  For Internet transactions, be sure the Web site offers&nbsp; secure data encryption and other services to protect your personal information.<br><br>
  
  In offline transactions don't provide credit card numbers, financial account numbers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; personal identifying information over the phone unless you know the&nbsp; communication line is secure. Ideally, you should initiate the phone conversation. <br><br>
  
  Lastly, there are recommended everyday practices, such as keeping an eye on postal mail&nbsp; to ensure your bills are arriving when they should be, and taking the time to properly&nbsp; dispose of paper documents that may contain credit card numbers and other identifying personal information.<br><br>
