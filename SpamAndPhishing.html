Spam is the electronic equivalent of the ‘junk mail’ that arrives on&nbsp;&nbsp; your doormat or in your postbox. However, spam is more than just&nbsp; annoying. It can be dangerous – especially if it’s part of a phishing&nbsp; scam.<br><br>

Spam emails are sent out in mass quantities by spammers and&nbsp; cybercriminals that are looking to do one or more of the following:
<ol>
<li>Make money from the small percentage of recipients that actually respond to the message</li>
<li>Run phishing scams – in order to obtain passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, and more</li>
<li>Spread malicious code onto recipients’ computers</li>
</ol>

How to protect yourself against spam email and phishing</font>

<font face="Californian FB" color="#00CC00" size="+2">
<p align="justify">

<ol>
<li><b><u>Set up multiple email addresses</u></b><br>
It’s a good idea to have at least two email addresses:</li></ol>
<ol type="i">
 <li>Private email address<br>
 This should only be used for personal correspondence.  Because spammers build lists of possible email addresses – by using combinations of obvious names, words, and numbers – you should try to make this address difficult for a spammer to guess.</li>
 <li>Public email address<br>
 Use this address when you need to register on public forums and in chat rooms, or to subscribe to mailing lists and other Internet services. </li></ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><b><u>Never respond to any spam</u></b><br>
Most spammers verify receipt and log responses.  The more you respond, the more spam you’re likely to receive.</li><br>

<li><b><u>Think before you click ‘unsubscribe’</u></b><br>
Spammers send fake unsubscribe letters, in an attempt to collect active email addresses.  If you click 'unsubscribe' in one of these letters, it may simply increase the amount of spam you receive.  Do not click on 'unsubscribe' links in emails that come from unknown sources.</li><br>

<li><b><u>Keep your browser updated</u></b><br>
Make sure that you use the latest version of your web browser and that all of the latest Internet security patches have been applied.</li><br>

<li><b><u>Use anti-spam filters</u></b><br>
Only open email accounts with providers that include spam filtering.  Choose an antivirus and Internet security solution that also includes advanced anti-spam features.</li><br>
