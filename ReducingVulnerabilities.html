<p align="justify">While formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible, it is not yet common. Operating systems formally verified include seL4, and SYSGO's PikeOS – but these make up a very small percentage of the market.</p></font>

<font face="californian fbs" color="#00CC00" size="+2"><p align="justify">Cryptography properly implemented is now virtually impossible to directly break. Breaking them requires some non-cryptographic input, such as a stolen key, stolen plaintext (at either end of the transmission), or some other extra cryptanalytic information.</p>

<font face="californian fbs" color="#009900" size="+2">
<p align="justify">Two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. It requires "something you know"; a password or PIN, and "something you have"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.</p><img src="Reducing Vulnerabilities2.jpg" border="6" style="float:left;width:450px;height:300px;"></font><br><br>

<font face="californian fbs" color="#00CC00" size="+2">
<p align="justify">Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. Even in a highly disciplined environment, such as in military organizations, social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.</p></font>

<font face="californian fbs" color="#009900" size="+2">
<p align="justify">It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates, using a security scanner or/and hiring competent people responsible for security. The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful backing up and insurance.</p></font>
