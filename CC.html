<big>What is Cyber Crime?</big><br><br>
Computer crime, or cybercrime, is crime that involves a computer and a network. The computer may have been used in the commission of a crime, or it may be the target. <br>
Other resources define Cyber crime as offences that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motive to intentionally harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet (Chat rooms, emails, notice boards and groups) and mobile phones (SMS/MMS)".<br><br>

<big><u>Why</u> Cyber Crime?</big><br><br>
Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities.<br>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Fraud and financial crime 
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Computer fraud is any dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to let another to do or refrain from doing something which                  causes loss. In this context, the fraud will result in obtaining a benefit by: 
                     <ol>
                         <li>Altering in an unauthorized way. This requires little technical expertise and is common form of theft by employees altering the data                               before entry or entering false data, or by entering  unauthorized instructions or using unauthorized processes;
                         <li>Altering, destroying, suppressing, or stealing output, usually to conceal unauthorized transactions. This is difficult to detect;
                         <li>Altering or deleting stored data
                    </ol>
          </ul>
    <li>Cyberterrorism
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Cyberterrorism in general, can be defined as an act of terrorism committed through the use of                              cyberspace or computer resources (Parker 1983). As such, a simple propaganda in the Internet, that                    there will be bomb attacks during the holidays can be considered cyberterrorism. 
            <li>As well there are also hacking activities directed towards individuals, families, organized by groups                     within networks, tending to cause fear among people, demonstrate power, collecting information                        relevant for ruining peoples' lives, robberies, blackmailing etc.
        </ul>
    <li>Cyberextortion
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to or threatened with repeated denial of service or                  other attacks by malicious hackers. These hackers demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and to offer "protection".
            <li>According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, cyberextortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling                    their ability to operate and demanding payments to restore their service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI                  and many go unreported in order to keep the victim's name out of the public domain. Perpetrators typically use a distributed denial-of-                 service attack.
        <li>An example of cyberextortion was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_hack" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none"> the attack on Sony Pictures of 2014.</a>
        </ul>
    <li>Cyberwarfare
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) notes that the cyberspace has emerged as a national-level concern through several recent events of                     geo-strategic significance. Among those are included, the attack on Estonia's infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers.
        </ul>
</ul> <br><br>
These various hackers and computer coding 'enthusiasts' use their computer as the tool and use others' computers as a target of their hacking.<br><br>
